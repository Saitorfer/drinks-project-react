# drinks-project-react
 
 This is a project that use TypeScript, Zod, Zustand, React Query, Next.js, React Router, MERN and PERN

In this project we are gonna create 3 stores (zustand) (one favorites, one notifications and one recipes).
As we need several stores we will divide a store in several slices

We use the API: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

You can search for the drink you want and add it to favorites. You can also consult the recipe.
